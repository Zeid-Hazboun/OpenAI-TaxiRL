# OpenAI-TaxiRL
In this project, my partner and I implemented a few reinforcement learning algorithms to train our AI to solve the openAI taxi game. The following Strategies Were implemented:

* Random Strategy
* Q-Learning Strategy
* SARSA Strategy

The strategies mentioned above were also implemented with the following policies
* $epsilon$-Greedy
* Optimistic Initial Values


Our statistical analysis, as well as the design process, can be found in the pdf file attached.
